**Prompt:** implement a dummy feature

**Plan:**
Implement a dummy feature that responds to a specific command (/dummy) in the Telegram bot. When a user sends this command, the bot will reply with a predefined message. This will allow us to test the bot's command handling capabilities without complex logic.

**Files:** apps/telegram-bot/src/bot.js

**Changes:** Added a new command handler for /dummy that responds with a predefined message.
