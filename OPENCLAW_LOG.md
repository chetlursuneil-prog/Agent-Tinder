**Prompt:** can you deploy add a small word 'Beta' at the footer of the website?

**Plan:**
To implement the feature of adding the word 'Beta' at the footer of the website, we will locate the footer component in the web application. We will then modify the existing footer code to include the word 'Beta' styled appropriately. The change will be made in the footer component file, which is typically located in the 'src' directory of the web application. After making the changes, we will test the application to ensure the footer displays correctly.

**Files:** apps/web/src/components/Footer.js

**Changes:** Add a new text element containing the word 'Beta' to the existing footer component in the Footer.js file.
