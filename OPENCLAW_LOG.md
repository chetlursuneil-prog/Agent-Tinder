**Prompt:** can you add a small text 'Beta' at the right hand corner in the footer of the website?

**Plan:**
To add a small text 'Beta' in the footer of the website, we will locate the footer component in the web application's layout files. We will then append a new div containing the 'Beta' text to the footer section, ensuring it is styled properly to appear at the right-hand corner.

**Files:** apps/web/src/components/Footer.js, apps/web/src/styles/footer.css

**Changes:** Added a new div with the text 'Beta' to the Footer component and applied CSS to position it at the right-hand corner.
