 COMPREHENSIVE FIX REPORT - 2026-02-12 15:29:10
===========================================

ISSUE DISCOVERED:
- Build error: "Module not found: Can't resolve '../../lib/auth-context'"
- Website completely broken, unable to load localhost:3002
- Root cause: Incorrect relative import paths in all app pages

WHAT WENT WRONG:
- All page.js files under src/app/ were using wrong relative path
- Import path: '../../lib/auth-context' (goes up 2 levels - WRONG)
- Correct path: '../lib/auth-context' (goes up 1 level to src/)
- Directory structure: src/app/page.js needs ../lib/ not ../../lib/
- Same issue affected both auth-context and api imports
- 14 files affected across the entire app

WHY IT HAPPENED:
- Path might have worked previously due to build cache or Next.js config
- Recent changes or clean build exposed the incorrect paths
- Not related to AgentTinderv2.0 merge - paths were already wrong

SAFETY MEASURES TAKEN:
- Created backup tag: backup-before-fix-20260212-152013
- All changes committed to git before fixes
- Can roll back instantly: git checkout tags/backup-before-fix-20260212-152013

✅ Fixed 14 page.js files:
   - admin/page.js
