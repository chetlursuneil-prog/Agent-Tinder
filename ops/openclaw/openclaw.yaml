## Minimal OpenClaw workspace config (template)
# Save as ops/openclaw/openclaw.yaml and edit paths as needed.
workspace:
  name: agenttinder-local
  bind_address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  allow_remote: false

agents: []

# notes: this is a template only. Install Open-Claw on the VPS and point
# its config to bind to 127.0.0.1 and port 8080 to keep it local-only.
# OpenClaw configuration (template)
workspace_root: /home/ubuntu/agenttinder
allow_file_edits: true
enable_git: true
git_user: ubuntu

# Command whitelist: OpenClaw is only permitted to run these commands via the agent
command_whitelist:
  - git
  - npm
  - node
  - ls
  - cat
  - echo

# Dangerous commands that must never be executed by the agent
forbidden_commands:
  - rm -rf /
  - shutdown
  - reboot
  - dd
  - ':(){ :|:& };:'
  - curl http://169.254.169.254

# HTTP binding: MUST be localhost for Free Tier safety and to avoid exposure
http_bind_address: 127.0.0.1
http_port: 8080

notes: |
  This is a safety-first configuration template. Do NOT expose OpenClaw to the public internet.
  When you replace the stub with a production agent, ensure strict command whitelisting and
  authentication headers are enforced.
